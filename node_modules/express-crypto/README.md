# express-crypto

This module allows you to encrypt the data transmitted via REST API in use with [node-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).

## Installation

## Implementate as middleware module

You can implementate this module as middleware module in express:

```
.
.
.

const app = express();
const crypto = require('express-crypto');

.
.

app.use(crypto({ secret: 'secret123' }, app));
.
.
```

## Reference

##### crypto([options], fn)

In the first propertie it's necessary to define the configuration for `express-crypto`. The second propertie must define as the express function where's defined as `app` in my example.

##### options as object

- secret: Define the Secret for the encryption.
- warningheader: Define a warningheader for the response when the request is not encrypted. Set it to false do deactivate. Default is `This service supports an encrypted content in all rest calls. Please contact us for maximum of security!`
- limit: Define the content limit. Default is `10mb`
- debug: Set it to true when you like debug information in console


## Call an encrypted REST calls

This middleware module validate the `content-type` and the additional `content-encrypted` header in the request. If the `content-type` equal `application/text` and the `content-encrypted` equal `aes` this module expect an encrypted content. So the module will decrypt the content from request and encrypt the response with the defined secret.

The big advantage of this module is the definition in the middleware of `express`. So you can work with your decrypted Objects in all the routes of the API.
